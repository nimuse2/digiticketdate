# Digitickets 

## Task title 

Create a date validator form in html and JS that will check that a given date is a valid historical date. The user should be instructed to use the format DD/MM/YYYY. Any non-valid dates or strings which do not match this format should be rejected. The validator should not use any packages. While not required we would appreciate it if you could include tests for the JS code.

## Notes

A very basic response to task. With development could be expanded to include other tests, and key stroke error messages and guidance for user to help reach correct format.  At present is very basic messaging and functionality. 

## Issues

Does not test for whitespace, special characters, different languages. Would add these in future developments

## Tests

Have done 2 very simple tests using the React/ jest testing library.  These should be expanded on alongside development of more sophisticated error checking. Please run `npm test` from command line to invoke.
