## Task title 

Create a date validator form in html and JS that will check that a given date is a valid historical date. The user should be instructed to use the format DD/MM/YYYY. Any non-valid dates or strings which do not match this format should be rejected. The validator should not use any packages. While not required we would appreciate it if you could include tests for the JS code.
